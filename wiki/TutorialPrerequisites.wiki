#summary System prerequisites for CUDA programming.

= Prerequisites =

To get started programming with CUDA, download and install the [http://www.nvidia.com/getcuda CUDA Toolkit and developer driver].  The toolkit contains `nvcc`, the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler, and other tools necessary to develop CUDA applications. To execute CUDA programs, you'll also need a [http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_gpus.html CUDA-compatible GPU].

You can confirm that the CUDA Toolkit is correctly installed on your machine by running `nvcc --version` from a command line.  For example, on a Windows XP machine,

{{{
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC>nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2009 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Tue_Feb_23_16:37:32_PST_2010
Cuda compilation tools, release 3.0, V0.2.1221
}}}

outputs the compiler information. If the previous command was not successful, then the CUDA Toolkit is likely not installed, or the path to `nvcc` (`C:\CUDA\bin` on Windows machines, `/usr/local/cuda/bin` on POSIX OSes) is not part of your `PATH` environment variable.

Now that our system is configured, let's start [TutorialAHeterogeneousProgrammingModel coding]!
